# Development

A few notes regarding developing Form Tools. Up until 3.0.14 it was just a question of cloning the repo and loading it 
up in your browser, but now we've finally added a proper build process.


### Technologies

- grunt
- yarn
- webpack

### Local development

With 3.0.14 Form Tools source code was moved to a `src/` folder in the repo and all build artifacts are generated
into a `dist/` folder.

After checking out the repo run these commands.

```
yarn install
grunt 
```

That generates the `dist/` folder and sets up watchers to copy over any edited files to your `dist/` folder. Only ever
edit files in your `src/` folder. You'll probably want to tell your IDE to ignore the dist folder contents so you don't
accidentally find yourself editing those files.

Also, add the following line to the generated `config.php` file in `dist/global` folder.

```php
$g_dev_mode = true;
```

That is used to load local resources rather than bundled ones.

### Linking components (modules, themes, API) for local development 

Each component is in its own repo, but for seeing them in your local dev environment they needs to be copied over
into the dist/ folder.

To work on components locally, _check the module out into the same folder as the core repo_, and create a `local.dev.js` file with the following content:

```
module.exports = {
	modules: [
		'module-custom_fields',
		'module-data_visualization',
		'module-export_manager'
	],
	themes: [
		'theme_classicgrey',
	],
	api: 'api'
};
```

Just add whatever module, theme folders you want. The api is a singleton: so just enter a string value for the API folde rname.

Now when you boot up grunt it'll automatically copy over the components to your dist folder - and set up watchers to 
copy the files as you edit them in the original repo.


### Localization 

Grunt has a few commands to simplify dealing with all the localization.

```
# adds a key to all lang files. Requires the key to exist in the en_us.php file first.
grunt addI18nKey --key=word_hello 

# removes a key from all files
grunt removeI18nKey --key=word_goodbye

# sort the keys
grunt sortI18nKeys
```


### Generating release package

Everything is published to a dist/ folder (not checked in). The generated `dist/` folder is what's actually part of the 
release packages found on github.

Since github doesn't provide options to only publish the contents of a subfolder, generating packages is a manual process:  
 
- Check out second repo. Give the folder the name `formtools_releases`.
- Check out the `releases` branch. 
- In the first repo, run `grunt publish`: that generates the `dist/` folder, copy it into the other repo
and create a tag with the name specified. 

Please note:
- the main `global/Core.class.php` should have been updated with the correct version.

At that point we can just generate the new release from the `releases` branch via github as before.
